"""``yoke`` — the unified agent-facing operations CLI entrypoint.

Every harness tool call runs ``yoke hook evaluate <event>`` at least twice, so
that one command is answered before anything else loads: it only hands the
payload to the machine-local hook resident over its Unix socket, and the
command catalog would cost it hundreds of milliseconds per call. Every other
invocation routes through :mod:`yoke_cli.command_router`.
